Title: City Communication Network with Reliability and Cost Constraints

Algorithms:
// TODO
a) produce a communication network with minimal possible cost while satisfying reliability contraints
b) produce a communication network with maximum possible reliability while satisfying cost contraints

Algorithm:
Input: N, [Ci], [Ri], a_b
number of cities, N(N-1)/2 cost constraint values. N(N-1)/2 reliability contraint values.
(NOTE: only N(N-1)/2 values are needed because matrices are symmetrical)
Output: Graphs G with N vertices and E edges
